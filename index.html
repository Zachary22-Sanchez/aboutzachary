		<h1><strong>About Zachary Sanchez</strong></h1>
		<p>I was born and raised in Albuquerque and currently reside with my wife and our 5 kids. I enjoy cooking in my spare time and would eventually like to open a food truck selling french toast.</p>
		<p> I also enjoy creating music.  My favorite instrument is the banjo, although I also play the accordion. </p>

		<p>Prior to taking this course I was a 911 dispatcher for 6 years with APD. I enjoyed the job but not the stress. I am looking for a new path to a rewarding career.</p>
		<p>I was excited to find this Bootcamp since I will get out in time for my side-gig as Santa Clause at the mall.  My favorite part is promising the kids that I will bring them everything on their wish lists. </p>
